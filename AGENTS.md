This is the documentation repository of LibreTranslate, a free and open source translation API.

# Where to find contents

- `src/docs`: directory with documentation pages in mdx and markdown format

# Rules

- The tone of translation should be technical. The context of translation is that of drone mapping software and photogrammetry.
- When updating translations, always look at the current git diff to see which sections were changed. If there are no active changes in the current branch, compare against the latest commit (git diff HEAD~1 HEAD)
- Never edit or commit any file in `src/content/docs/api`, `src/content/docs/reference`, `src/content/docs/tutorials`, `src/content/index.mdx` or `src/content/*.md`. These are the original English pages
- Always preserve images in the proper places.
- Each translation for other languages, like Italian or Spanish, needs to be added as subfolder in `src/content/docs/[langcode]`, where `langcode` is the 2 letter ISO 639 language code. For example, Italian docs go in `src/content/docs/it/`.
- Each translation must have an `index.mdx` and copies of each subfolder (`api`, `reference`, `tutorials`) and a copy of each markdown file in each subfolder. Always verify that the number of pages match.
- Always create/update ALL the markdown files when asked to add or update a translation.
- Always translate from English, never from another language.
- Always verify all translations for accuracy and completeness in all markdown files, then fix all inaccuracies and fill any missing section, if any.
- When translating internal links, we always reference them with the appropriate URL that maps to a markdown file of the translation.
- Never modify any other file other than those in `src/content` or `astro.config.mjs` without explicit permission.
- When translating, always check that all the sidebar items in `astro.config.mjs` have a proper translation item in the `translations` key.
- At the top of markdown documents, make sure to always fill in the template preamble `---` with `title: <translated title>` and `template: doc` 

# How to build / check that the website builds

npm run build
```

The outputs will be in `dist/`.

# Glossaries / Nuances

These words / sentences should be treated carefully:

## Machine

Should be interpreted as "computer" or "system" (not a literal machine).

E.g. in Spanish use "equipo" or "computadora", not "máquina".
